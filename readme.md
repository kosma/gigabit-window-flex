# Flex PCB Ethernet Window Passthrough
![img.png](img.png)
## Overview

This open-source project provides a flexible PCB designed to act as a window passthrough for Ethernet cables, ensuring seamless gigabit data transfer. Ideal for setups where drilling holes is not an option, this solution maintains high-speed connectivity while preserving the integrity of your space.

## Features
- **Ideal length**: Flexible part is 265mm, but if you want you can customize it.
- **High-Speed Data Transfer:** Supports gigabit Ethernet transfer rates.
- **Flexible Design:** Easily fits through window gaps without damage.
- **Easy Installation:** Simple to set up, with no need for specialized tools or equipment.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Prepare the Window Gap:**
   Ensure the window gap is clean and wide enough to accommodate the flex PCB.

2. **Insert the Flex PCB:**
   Carefully insert the PCB through the window gap, ensuring it is not bent or twisted excessively.

3. **Connect the Ethernet Cables:**
   Attach Ethernet cables to both ends of the flex PCB.

4. **Secure the Setup:**
   Close the window gently to hold the flex PCB in place, avoiding any sharp bends.

5. **Test the Connection:**
   Verify the Ethernet connection to ensure gigabit data transfer is active.
